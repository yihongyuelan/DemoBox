(Derulo)
\n
\n
It\'s too hard to sleep\n
I got the sheets on the floor\n
Nothing on me\n
And I can\'t take it no more\n
It\'s a hundred degrees\n
I got one foot out the door\n
Where are my keys?
Cause I gotta leave, yeah\n
\n
In the back of the cab\n
I tipped the driver ahead of time\n
Get me there fast\n
I got your body on my mind\n
I want it bad\n
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high\n
\n
Girl, you\'re the one I want to want me\n
And if you want me, girl, you got me\n
There\'s nothin\' I, no, I wouldn\'t do, I wouldn\'t do\n
Just to get up next to you\n
\n
Girl, you\'re the one I want to want me\n
And if you want me, girl, you got me\n
There\'s nothin\' I, no, I wouldn\'t do, I wouldn\'t do\n
Just to get up next to you\n
Just to get up next to you\n
\n
You open the door\n
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the floor\n
And you whisper in my ear, \"Baby, I\'m yours.\"\n
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high\n
\n
Girl, you\'re the one I want to want me\n
And if you want me, girl, you got me\n
There\'s nothin\' I, no, I wouldn\'t do, I wouldn\'t do\n
Just to get up next to you\n
\n
Girl, you\'re the one I want to want me\n
And if you want me, girl, you got me\n
There\'s nothin\' I, no, I wouldn\'t do, I wouldn\'t do\n
Just to get up next to you\n
Just to get up next to you\n
\n
Just the thought of you gets me so high, so high\n
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high\n
\n
Girl, you\'re the one I want to want me\n
And if you want me, girl, you got me\n
There\'s nothin\' I, no, I wouldn\'t do, I wouldn\'t do\n
Just to get up next to you\n
\n
Girl, you\'re the one I want to want me\n
And if you want me, girl, you got me\n
There\'s nothin\' I, no, I wouldn\'t do, I wouldn\'t do\n
Just to get up next you (I would do anything)\n
Just to get up next you (anything and everything)\n
Just to get up next to you (baby)\n
Just to get up next to you\n
Get up, get up!</item>
        <item>I don\'t like your little games\n
Don\'t like your tilted stage\n
The role you made me play\n
Of the fool, no, I don\'t like you\n
I don\'t like your perfect crime\n
How you laugh when you lie\n
You said the gun was mine\n
Isn\'t cool, no, I don\'t like you (oh!)\n
\n
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time\n
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time\n
I\'ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined\n
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!\n
\n
Ooh, look what you made me do\n
Look what you made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
Look what you just made me\n
Ooh, look what you made me do\n
Look what you made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
\n
I don\'t like your kingdom keys\n
They once belonged to me\n
You asked me for a place to sleep\n
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)\n
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama\n
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma\n
And then the world moves on, but one thing\'s for sure\n
Maybe I got mine, but you\'ll all get yours\n
\n
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time\n
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time\n
I\'ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined\n

\n
Ooh, look what you made me do\n
Look what you made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
Look what you just made me\n
Ooh, look what you made me do\n
Look what you made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
\n
I don\'t trust nobody and nobody trusts me\n
I\'ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams\n
I don\'t trust nobody and nobody trusts me\n
I\'ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams\n
I don\'t trust nobody and nobody trusts me\n
I\'ll be the actress starring in your bad dreamsv
I don\'t trust nobody and nobody trusts me\n
I\'ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams\n
(Look what you made me do)\n
(Look what you made me do)\n
(Look what you just made me do)\n
(Look what you made me do)\n
"I\'m sorry, the old Taylor can\'t come to the phone right now."\n
"Why?"\n
"Oh, \'cause she\'s dead!" (ohh!)\n
\n
Ooh, look what you made me do\n
Look what you made me do\n
Look what you just made me do\n
Look what you just made me\n
Ooh, look what you made me do\n

        <item>\"Baby\"\n
\n
Oh whoa\n
Oh whoa\n
Oh whoa\n
\n
You know you love me, I know you care\n
Just shout whenever, and I\'ll be there\n
You are my love, you are my heart\n
And we would never ever ever be apart\n
\n
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing\n
We\'re just friends, what are you saying?\n
Say there\'s another and look right in my eyes\n
My first love broke my heart for the first time\n
And I was like\n
\n
Baby, baby, baby oooh\n
Like baby, baby, baby nooo\n
Like baby, baby, baby oooh\n
I thought you\'d always be mine (mine)\n
\n
Baby, baby, baby oooh\n
Like baby, baby, baby nooo\n
Like baby, baby, baby oooh\n
I thought you\'d always be mine (mine)\n
\n
Oh, for you I would have done whatever\n
And I just can\'t believe we ain\'t together\n
And I wanna play it cool, but I\'m losin\' you\n
I\'ll buy you anything, I\'ll buy you any ring\n
And I\'m in pieces, baby fix me\n
And just shake me \'til you wake me from this bad dream\n
I\'m going down, down, down, down\n
And I just can\'t believe my first love won\'t be around\n
\n
And I\'m like\n
Baby, baby, baby oooh\n
Like baby, baby, baby nooo\n
Like baby, baby, baby oooh\n
I thought you\'d always be mine (mine)\n
\n
Baby, baby, baby oooh\n
Like baby, baby, baby nooo\n
Like baby, baby, baby oooh\n
I thought you\'d always be mine (mine)\n
\n
\n
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,\n
There was nobody that compared to my baby\n
And nobody came between us or could ever come above\n
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,\n
She woke me up daily, don\'t need no Starbucks.\n
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and\n
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.\n
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing\n
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying\n
\n
Baby, baby, baby oooh\n
Like baby, baby, baby nooo\n
Like baby, baby, baby oooh\n
I thought you\'d always be mine (mine)\n
\n
Baby, baby, baby oooh\n
Like baby, baby, baby nooo\n
Like baby, baby, baby oooh\n
I thought you\'d always be mine (mine)\n
\n
I\'m gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)\n
Now I\'m all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)\n
Now I\'m all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)\n
Now I\'m all gone (gone, gone, gone)\n
I\'m gone</item>
